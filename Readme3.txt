Solution to homework 3 from:
https://softuni.bg/downloads/svn/qa-automation/03.%20QA-Automation-Selenium-Advanced/03.%20QA-Automation-Selenium-WebDriver-Advanced-Exercises.docx

The new homework tests are in RgistrationFormTests.cs

See the two Excel files in \\SeleniumTestsDemoQaPage\DataDrivenTests - from Possible negative tests.xlsx 'First iteration', I took the scenarios and implemented them in UserData.xlsx

Also, I included here the exercises from the lecture PopUp, Dragable, etc. - they are interesting, too.

Some tests work properly only on Chrome because of the drivers...

If you don't get a screenshot of a failed test, delete the old screenshot from \Logs folder first!

If Registration tests don't want to run, check if you have Koala.jpg in the Sample Pictures folder.
